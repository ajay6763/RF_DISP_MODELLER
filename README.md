# RF_DISP_MODELLER
It is GUI based forward modelling tool for P-wave receiver functions and surface wave dispersion curves. To use it you need to have installed and in you path Computer Programmes in Seismology (CPS, Herrmann, 2013) [http://www.eas.slu.edu/eqc/eqccps.html] 
This module is planned to be coupled with LitMod2D_2.O post-processing toolbox. 

## Input
1. Calculated reciever functions.
2. Calculated dispersion curves.
3. Starting velocity model. (from LitMod output)
